### Project Title
Project 3: Highlighting Bikeshare on GitHub

### Description
This project demonstrates the knowledge of using version control by adding Project 2 to a public repository on my GitHub. In the Bikeshare project, using Pandas, Numpy and Python, I was able to explore data across Chicago, Washington DC, and New York City. Now, a user can use the bikeshare.py file to view statistics collected by that data.
